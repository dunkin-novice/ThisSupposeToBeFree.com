            <p>Hello!</p>
            <p>I created "This Suppose To Be Free" out of a simple frustration: too many basic online tools are becoming expensive subscription services. Need to convert a few images? That'll be $10 a month. Need to edit a simple document? Sign up for a free trial.</p>
            <p>I believe that simple tasks shouldn't require a credit card. This project is my protest. It's a growing collection of high-quality, truly free, and unlimited tools that do one thing and do it well, right in your browser. Nothing is uploaded to a server, and there are no hidden limits.</p>
            <p>This is a community-driven project. If you have an idea for a tool that you believe should be free, please let me know. Let's build a more useful internet together.</p>
