                <h2>The Story So Far...</h2>
                <p>I was just trying to optimize images for SEO — simple stuff. But every site I found either limited me or threw a paywall in my face. Eventually, I realized most of it could be done for free, right in your browser.</p>
                <p>So I built my own tool… and it actually worked. That’s when I thought, why not share it? Let’s annoy the people who once annoyed us — and maybe make a little pocket money along the way.</p>
                <p>And who knows — if more of us start building out of frustration, maybe we can make the internet a little more fun again. Paying for good software is fair, but come on… image converters? That stuff should’ve been free ages ago.</p>

                <h2>My Road to a Million</h2>
                <p>Is this project a get-rich-quick scheme? Probably not. But is it a step towards building something cool, helping people out, and maybe one day hitting that millionaire milestone? Absolutely. Your support helps turn that dream into a plan.</p>
