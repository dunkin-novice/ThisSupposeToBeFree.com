                <h2>The Story So Far...</h2>
                <p style="text-align: left; max-width: 650px; margin: 20px auto;">
                    I was just trying to optimize images for SEO — simple stuff. But every site I found either limited me or threw a paywall in my face. Eventually, I realized most of it could be done for free, right in your browser.
                    <br><br>
                    So I built my own tool… and it actually worked. That’s when I thought, why not share it? Let’s annoy the people who once annoyed us — and maybe make a little pocket money along the way.
                    <br><br>
                    And who knows — if more of us start building out of frustration, maybe we can make the internet a little more fun again. Paying for good software is fair, but come on… image converters? That stuff should’ve been free ages ago.
