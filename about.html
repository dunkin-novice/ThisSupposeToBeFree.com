                <h2>A simple protest.</h2>
                <p>This project started with a simple, frustrating question: why does every useful online tool eventually end up behind a paywall, a signup form, or an invasive ad network? Even basic things like converting an image format now come with limits, watermarks, and privacy concerns.</p>
                
                <h2>Our Statement of Belief.</h2>
                <p>We believe essential digital tools should be accessible to everyone, without compromise. We believe your data is yours alone, which is why our tools run directly in your browser. Nothing is ever uploaded to our servers because, well, we don't have any.</p>
                
                <h2>Join the Cause.</h2>
                <p>This is an open, community-driven project. If you have an idea for a tool that "supposes to be free," or if you're a developer who wants to contribute, we'd love to hear from you. Together, we can build a more useful—and more free—corner of the web.</p>
