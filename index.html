                <h2>"I'm just a marketing guy who got tired of 'freemium' limits."</h2>
                <p>Day in, day out, I was trying to optimize images for SEO. Every tool I found hit me with a paywall or a ridiculous daily limit. Turns out, most of this stuff can be done for free right in your browser. This site is my protest against the subscription-everything world, built for everyone who's been there. No limits, no uploads, no BS.</p>

                <p>Some people make genuinely awesome, free stuff for the internet. I don't know them personally, but they deserve a shout-out.</p>

                    <strong>Heads up:</strong> Some of these are affiliate links. If you click one and make a purchase, I might get a small kickback at no extra cost to you. I only recommend stuff I've used and believe in.

                    <h3>Canva</h3>
                    <p>For anything design-related. Their free tier is incredibly generous and powerful enough for most projects.</p>

                    <h3>Namecheap</h3>
