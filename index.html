            <section class="info-box">
                <p>I was just trying to optimize images for SEO — simple stuff. But every site I found either limited me or threw a paywall in my face. Eventually, I realized most of it could be done for free, right in your browser.</p>
                <p>So I built my own tool… and it actually worked. That’s when I thought, why not share it? Let’s annoy the people who once annoyed us — and maybe make a little pocket money along the way.</p>
                <p>And who knows — if more of us start building out of frustration, maybe we can make the internet a little more fun again. Paying for good software is fair, but come on… image converters? That stuff should’ve been free ages ago.</p>

                        <p>The gold standard for creating favicons. Simple, fast, and does the job perfectly. A huge inspiration for this project.</p>

                    <strong>Heads up:</strong> Some of these are affiliate links. If you click one and make a purchase, I might get a small kickback at no extra cost to you. I only recommend stuff I've used and believe in.
