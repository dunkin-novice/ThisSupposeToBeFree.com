                <h2>"I'm just a marketing guy who got tired of 'freemium' limits."</h2>
                <p>Day in, day out, I was trying to optimize images for SEO. Every tool I found hit me with a paywall or a ridiculous daily limit. Turns out, most of this stuff can be done for free right in your browser. This site is my protest against the subscription-everything world, built for everyone who's been there. No limits, no uploads, no BS.</p>
