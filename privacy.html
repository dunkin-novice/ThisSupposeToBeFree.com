                <h2>We don't want your data. Period.</h2>
                <p>We don’t store, track, or sell anything. In fact, we don’t even want your email. We have no databases, no user accounts, and no servers to store your files on.</p>

                <h2>How Our Tools Work</h2>
                <p>Every tool on this website runs entirely within your web browser (client-side). When you drop a file into our converter, it never leaves your computer. The conversion is handled by JavaScript running on your machine. This is the most secure and private way to build web tools.</p>
                
                <h2>Affiliate Links</h2>
                <p>On our homepage, we may recommend other tools we love. Some of these links might be "affiliate links," which means we could earn a small commission if you make a purchase, at no extra cost to you. We only recommend products we genuinely believe in. These external sites have their own privacy policies.</p>

                <h2>Analytics</h2>
                <p>We may use a privacy-respecting analytics service (like Plausible or Fathom) to count website visitors. This helps us understand what's popular, but it does so without using cookies or collecting any personal identifiable information (PII). We don't know who you are, and we don't want to.</p>
