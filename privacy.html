                <h2>We don't want your data. Period.</h2>
                <p>We don’t store, track, or sell anything. In fact, we don’t even want your email. We have no databases, no user accounts, and no servers to store your files on.</p>

                <h2>How Our Tools Work</h2>
                <p>Every tool on this website runs entirely within your web browser (client-side). When you drop a file into our converter, it never leaves your computer. The conversion is handled by JavaScript running on your machine. This is the most secure and private way to build web tools.</p>
                
                <h2>Affiliate Links</h2>
                <p>On our homepage, we may recommend other tools we love. Some of these links might be "affiliate links," which means we could earn a small commission if you make a purchase, at no extra cost to you. We only recommend products we genuinely believe in. These external sites have their own privacy policies.</p>

                <h2>Analytics & Advertising</h2>
                <p>We may use a privacy-respecting analytics service to count website visitors. We also use Google AdSense to display ads, which helps cover our server costs and keep the tools free. Google and its partners may use cookies to serve ads based on a user's prior visits to this website or other websites. You can opt out of personalized advertising by visiting <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ads Settings</a>.</p>
